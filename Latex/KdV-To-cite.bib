abstract = {Solitons: An Introduction discusses the theory of solitons and its diverse applications to nonlinear systems that arise in the physical sciences. Drazin and Johnson explain the generation and properties of solitons, introducing the mathematical technique known as the Inverse Scattering Tranform. Their aim is to present the essence of inverse scattering clearly, rather than rigorously or completely. Thus, the prerequisites are merely what is found in standard courses on mathematical physics and more advanced material is explained in the text with useful references to further reading given at the end of each chapter. Worked examples are frequently used to help the reader follow the various ideas and the exercises at the end of each chapter not only contain applications but also test understanding. Answers, or hints to their solution, are given at the end of the book. Sections and exercises that contain more difficult material are indicated by asterisks.},

abstract = {Central and upwind compact schemes for spatial discretization have been analyzed with respect to accuracy in spectral space, numerical stability and dispersion relation preservation. A von Neumann matrix spectral analysis is developed here to analyze spatial discretization schemes for any explicit and implicit schemes to investigate the full domain simultaneously. This allows one to evaluate various boundary closures and their effects on the domain interior. The same method can be used for stability analysis performed for the semi-discrete initial boundary value problems (IBVP). This analysis tells one about the stability for every resolved length scale. Some well-known compact schemes that were found to be G-K-S and time stable are shown here to be unstable for selective length scales by this analysis. This is attributed to boundary closure and we suggest special boundary treatment to remove this shortcoming. To demonstrate the asymptotic stability of the resultant schemes, numerical solution of the wave equation is compared with analytical solution. Furthermore, some of these schemes are used to solve two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equation and a computational acoustic problem to check their ability to solve problems for long time. It is found that those schemes, that were found unstable for the wave equation, are unsuitable for solving incompressible Navier–Stokes equation. In contrast, the proposed compact schemes with improved boundary closure and an explicit higher-order upwind scheme produced correct results. The numerical solution for the acoustic problem is compared with the exact solution and the quality of the match shows that the used compact scheme has the requisite DRP property.},

abstract = {A general theory is developed for studying changes of a wave train governed by non-linear partial differential equations. The technique is to average over the local oscillations in the medium and so obtain differential equations for the variations in amplitude, wave number, etc. It corresponds to the Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging technique for the ordinary differential equations of non-linear vibrations. The equations obtained in this way are hyperbolic and can be handled by the usual theory of quasi-linear hyperbolic systems, involving the theory of characteristics and shock waves. In this case the 'shocks' are abrupt changes in the amplitude, wave number, etc. They do not involve dissipation, but it turns out that frequency plays the role corresponding to entropy in ordinary gas dynamic shocks. It is not clear whether these shocks will really occur in practice. However, they have a number of interesting properties and seem to be relevant to the discussion of so-called collisionless shocks in plasma dynamics. The main applications envisaged are to water waves and plasma dynamics, and the theory is developed using typical equations from these areas. If the original equations are linear, this theory predicts the usual description of dispersive waves in terms of group velocity, so it may be considered as an extension of the group velocity concept to non-linear problems. Mathematically, the theory may be considered as an extension of some of the methods and ideas for the non-linear ordinary differential equations of vibration theory to partial differential equations.},

@article{Zabusky2005a,
abstract = {This paper is mostly a history of the early years of nonlinear and computational physics and mathematics. I trace how the counterintuitive result of near-recurrence to an initial condition in the first scientific digital computer simulation led to the discovery of the soliton in a later computer simulation. The 1955 report by Fermi, Pasta, and Ulam (FPU) described their simulation of a one-dimensional nonlinear lattice which did not show energy equipartition. The 1965 paper by Zabusky and Kruskalshowed that the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) nonlinear partial differential equation, a long wavelength model of the alpha-lattice (or cubic nonlinearity), derived by Kruskal, gave quantitatively the same results obtained by FPU. In 1967, Zabusky and Deem showed that a localized short wavelength initial excitation (then called an "optical" and now a "zone-boundary mode" excitation ) of the alpha-lattice revealed "n-curve" coherent states. If the initial amplitude was sufficiently large energy equipartition followed in a short time. The work of Kruskal and Miura (KM), Gardner and Greene (GG), and myself led to the appreciation of the infinity of denumerable invariants (conservation laws) for Hamiltonian systems and to a procedure by GGKM in 1967 for solving KdV exactly. The nonlinear science field exponentiated in diversity of linkages (as described in Appendix A). Included were pure and applied mathematics and all branches of basic and applied physics, including the first nonhydrodynamic application to optical solitons, as described in a brief essay (Appendix B) by Hasegawa. The growth was also manifest in the number of meetings held and institutes founded, as described briefly in Appendix D. Physicists and mathematicians in Japan, USA, and USSR (in the latter two, people associated with plasma physics) contributed to the diversification of the nonlinear paradigm which continues worldwide to the present. The last part of the paper (and Appendix C) discuss visiometrics: the visualization and quantification of simulation data, e.g., projection to lower dimensions, to facilitate understanding of nonlinear phenomena for modeling and prediction (or design). Finally, I present some recent developments that are linked to my early work by: Dritschel (vortex dynamics via contour dynamics/surgery in two and three dimensions); Friedland (pattern formation by synchronization in Hamiltonian nonlinear wave, vortex, plasma, systems, etc.); and the author ("n-curve" states and energy equipartition in a FPU lattice).},
